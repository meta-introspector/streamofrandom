# Lean4 Formal Proof Strategy for Stream of Random

This document outlines the strategy for utilizing Lean4 for formal verification within the "Stream of Random" project, specifically focusing on proving the equivalence of Rust code to existing TypeScript functionalities.

## Intent

The primary intent is to achieve a "big win" by replacing ElizaOS plugins (originally in TypeScript) with binary-compatible Rust code, and formally proving this equivalence using Lean4. This process aims to ensure correctness and leverage strong types for enhanced reliability.

## The 42 Steps of Rewrites (Outline)

The formal proof process will involve approximately 42 steps of rewrites, encompassing the following high-level stages:

1.  **Code Preparation:**
    *   Write the initial Rust code that aims to replace the TypeScript functionality.
    *   Introspect the existing TypeScript code (using a Rust parser for TypeScript).

2.  **Conversion to Lean:**
    *   Convert the TypeScript code's structure and logic into Lean4 representations.
    *   Convert the Rust code's structure and logic into Lean4 representations.

3.  **Equivalence Proof:**
    *   For each function or module in the original TypeScript code, identify its corresponding function or module in the new Rust code.
    *   Formally prove in Lean4 that the Rust implementation is type-compatible and functionally equivalent to the TypeScript original. This will involve step-by-step proofs of properties, invariants, and behavior.

## Integration with Stream of Random

While the Lean4 development and proofs will be conducted in a separate, dedicated workspace (as indicated by the user), the outcomes and key findings of this formal verification effort will be documented and integrated into the `streamofrandom` project's overall quality assurance and development processes. This ensures that the project benefits from the enhanced reliability and correctness provided by formal methods.
